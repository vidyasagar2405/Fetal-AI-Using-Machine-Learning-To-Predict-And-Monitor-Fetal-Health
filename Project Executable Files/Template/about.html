            <p>Predicting and monitoring Fetal Health is an ML project that involves using machine learning algorithms to analyse and predict the patterns in the fetal health. Some pregnancies can be complicated by a medical condition in the mother (e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure) or a condition that might affect the health or development of the baby. The prevalence of high-risk pregnancies is higher in areas of lower resource - in India, e.g., about 20%–30% of pregnancies belong to the high-risk category, which is responsible for 75% of perinatal morbidity and mortality. If babies with potential difficulties could be identified, and if there were effective interventions to improve the outcomes, then an accurate test that could be used during pregnancy could be beneficial. Cardiotocography (CTG) is a continuous electronic record of the baby’s heart rate obtained via an ultrasound transducer placed on the mother’s abdomen. CTG monitoring is widely used to assess fetal wellbeing by identifying babies at risk of hypoxia (lack of oxygen), and is mainly used during labour. A review found that in the antenatal period (before labour), there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring women with high-risk pregnancies benefits the mother or baby, although additional research is needed to provide more information surrounding this practice. Moreover, CTG monitoring can sometimes lead to medical interventions which are not necessarily needed. Given the importance and necessity of an effective and reliable method to assess fetal and mother health, it is crucial to examine the CTG data, as it is widely used and relatively affordable. Data The dataset used in this notebook contains 2126 records of features extracted from CTG exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetricians into 3 classes: -Normal -Suspect -Pathological Based on the latest FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guidelines, the classes also provide additional insights.</p>
